=============
REGULAR LABS:
=============

0. Numpy and Pandas and other relevant Python libraries; What is dataset?; How to load a dataset? etc.

1. Matrix Manipulation using Numpy

2. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for (1) 1-D feature vectors, (2) 2-D features
	-- For (1) use MNIST. Flatten 28x28 to 1D.
	-- For (2) use MNIST as it is.
	-- Show them the difference in scores and other performances

3. Convolution Operation (using Numpy)

4. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
	-- Use MNIST
	-- Use CIFAR-10

5. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) -- simple RNNs
	-- Use sentiment classification (Twitter data)
	-- Spam e-mail classification

6. LSTM based RNNs
	-- Performance on time-series data (music generation, may be)

7. Auto-encoders (Variational AE)
	-- Show the representations learned for MNIST/CIFAR-10
	-- Word2Vec model demonstration

8. Deep Belief Network (DBN)
	-- Demonstration of Energy based models (EBM)

9. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
	-- Generating new digits using MNIST (mostly, wont work in 1 lab; must do)


================
SERIOUS PROJECT:
================

Mostly on GANs, or combination of (4) and (5): Will be decided
